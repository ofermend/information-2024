## [Vectara](https://vectara.com/) 

Vectara provides a Trusted Generative AI platform. Our serverless RAG-as-a-Service allows organizations to rapidly create AI assistants and agents which are grounded in the data, documents, and knowledge that they have. 

Developing your RAG applications with Vectara helps you address critical issues for enterprise adoption, namely: reducing hallucination, providing explainability / provenance, enabling real-time updatability of the knowledge, and mitigating of intellectual property / bias concerns from large language models.

Our platform's free tier is available to everyone to get started and build exciting applications and projects during this hackathon.

We will be offering a special prize of **$2000 in credits** on our platform for the best project that uses Vectara in the hackathon.
